# Rua Café Sales Prediction Project

This project focuses on analyzing the sales data of Rua Café, where I applied data analytics techniques to improve profitability. The goal was to predict future sales and provide insights into how to optimize the business performance. The project involved multiple stages, including data collection, data cleaning, machine learning modeling, and data visualization.

## Project Overview

Rua Café is a small business located in the heart of the city, and the aim of this project was to analyze its sales data, predict future trends, and provide actionable recommendations. The project was divided into the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Raw data was gathered from various sources, including sales records and customer data.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - The data was cleaned using SQL and Python to ensure that it was accurate and ready for analysis. This included handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - The cleaned data was uploaded into BigQuery for further analysis. This step included exploring trends in sales, identifying key factors affecting profitability, and understanding customer preferences.

4. **Sales Prediction**:
   - Machine learning techniques were applied to predict future sales using historical data. This model aimed to forecast sales trends for different time periods and help the café plan better for future demand.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Using Power BI, I created a series of interactive visualizations to present the findings and hypotheses about the factors that impact profitability. This allowed for a more intuitive understanding of the trends and patterns in the sales data.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: For data extraction and manipulation.
- **Python**: For data cleaning, analysis, and machine learning modeling.
- **BigQuery**: For storing and querying large datasets.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Machine Learning**: Various machine learning models were applied to predict future sales.
